    Migrated to use MyGene.info v3 API (For API changes, see here: http://docs.mygene.info/en/latest/doc/migration_from_v2.html).
    Added caching functions (using requests-cache) for all query types except when using "fetch_all".  Can turn request caching on with set_caching(), off with stop_caching().  The cache can be cleared with clear_cache().
    Made "fetch_all" feature compatible with Elasticsearch v2.x scroll changes.

    Return None when input geneid does not exist for getgene method.
    Switched to using requests for GET and POST from httplib2.
    New "get_fields" method to search for matching field names.
    New "fetch_all" parameter for query method to retrieve large query.
